<h4>Moroccan Hammam </h4>
<p><i>The Turkish Hammam (also Turkish Bath or Hamam) is the Middle Eastern variant of a steam bath,
   which can be categorized as a wet relative of the sauna. They had played an 
  important role in cultures of the Middle-East, serving as places of social-cultural gathering,
   ritual cleansing, healing treatments and as architectural structures, institutions, and (later) 
   elements with special customs attached to them. Europeans learned about the Hammam via contacts with
